# DeepLearning
Projects that I have carried out on deep learning

We will start out with some basics representation of Neural network and then go more and more in details. 

1. Logistic_Regression_with_a_Neural_Network_mindset is a notebook in which we will build a logistic regression classifier to recognize cats. This notebook will step us through how to do this with a Neural Network mindset, and so will also hone our intuitions about deep learning.
2. Planar_data_classification_with_onehidden_layer is a second project in which we developed our first neural network with one hidden layer. We will see a big difference between this model and the one we implemented using logistic regression.
